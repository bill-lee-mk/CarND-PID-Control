<p>PID stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative. Controllers
are designed to eliminate the need for continuous operator
attention. Cruise control in a car and a house thermostat are
common examples of how controllers are used to automatically
adjust some variable to hold the measurement (or process
variable) at the set-point. The set-point is where you would like
the measurement to be. Error is defined as the difference between
set-point and measurement. </p>

<p>(error) = (set-point) - (measurement) The variable being
adjusted is called the manipulated variable which usually is
equal to the output of the controller. The output of PID
controllers will change in response to a <strong>change</strong>
in measurement or set-point. Manufacturers of PID controllers use
different names to identify the three modes. These equations show
the relationships: </p>

<pre>P   <a href="http://www2.metso.com/MetsoTutor.aspx#P">Proportional Band</a> = 100/gain
I            <a href="http://www2.metso.com/MetsoTutor.aspx#I">Integral</a> = 1/reset          (units of time)
D          <a href="http://www2.metso.com/MetsoTutor.aspx#D">Derivative</a> = rate = pre-act   (units of time)
</pre>

<p>Depending on the manufacturer, integral or reset action is set
in either time/repeat or repeat/time. One is just the reciprocal
of the other. Note that manufacturers are not consistent and
often use reset in units of time/repeat or integral in units of
repeats/time. Derivative and rate are the same.</p>

<p>Choosing the proper values for P, I, and D is called "PID
Tuning".</p>


<h3><a name="P"></a>Proportional Band</h3>

<p>With proportional band, the controller output is proportional
to the error or a change in measurement (depending on the
controller). </p>

<div align="center">(controller output) = (error)*100/(proportional
band) </div>

<p>With a proportional controller offset (deviation from
set-point) is present. Increasing the controller gain will make
the loop go unstable. Integral action was included in controllers
to eliminate this offset. </p>

<h3><a name="I"></a>Integral</h3>

<p>With integral action, the controller output is proportional to
the amount of time the error is present. Integral action
eliminates offset. </p>

<div align="center">CONTROLLER OUTPUT = (1/INTEGRAL) (Integral of)
e(t) d(t) </div>

<br clear="all">

<p><img src="./What is PID tutorial overview_files/TEACH1A.GIF" align="center" hspace="3" width="498" height="288" alt="Load Step Time Response" title="Load Step Time Response"> </p>

<br clear="all">

<p>Notice that the offset (deviation from set-point) in the time
response plots is now gone. Integral action has eliminated the
offset. The response is somewhat oscillatory and can be
stabilized some by adding derivative action. (Graphic courtesy of
ExperTune Loop Simulator.) </p>

<p>Integral action gives the controller a large gain at low
frequencies that results in eliminating offset and "beating
down" load disturbances. The controller phase starts out at
â€“90 degrees and increases to near 0 degrees at the break
frequency. This additional phase lag is what you give up by
adding integral action. Derivative action adds phase lead and is
used to compensate for the lag introduced by integral action. </p>

<h3><a name="D"></a>Derivative</h3>

<p>With derivative action, the controller output is proportional
to the rate of change of the measurement or error. The controller
output is calculated by the rate of change of the measurement
with time. </p>

<pre>                                      dm
      CONTROLLER OUTPUT = DERIVATIVE ----
                                      dt
</pre>

<p>Where <i>m</i> is the measurement at time <i>t</i>. </p>

<p>Some manufacturers use the term rate or pre-act instead of
derivative. Derivative, rate, and pre-act are the same thing. </p>

<div align="center">DERIVATIVE = RATE = PRE ACT </div>

<p>Derivative action can compensate for a changing measurement.
Thus derivative takes action to inhibit more rapid changes of the
measurement than proportional action. When a load or set-point
change occurs, the derivative action causes the controller gain
to move the "wrong" way when the measurement gets near
the set-point. Derivative is often used to avoid overshoot. </p>

<p>Derivative action can stabilize loops since it adds phase
lead. Generally, if you use derivative action, more controller
gain and reset can be used. </p>

<img src="./What is PID tutorial overview_files/FREQ.GIF" align="center" hspace="3" width="480" height="357" alt="Frequency" title="Frequency Response">

<br clear="all">
<p>
With a PID controller the
amplitude ratio now has a dip near the center of the frequency response.
Integral action gives the controller high gain at low frequencies, and
derivative action causes the gain to start rising after the "dip".
At higher frequencies the filter on derivative action limits the derivative
action. At very high frequencies (above 314 radians/time; the Nyquist
frequency) the controller phase and amplitude ratio increase and decrease
quite a bit because of discrete sampling. If the controller had no filter the
controller amplitude ratio would steadily increase at high frequencies up to
the Nyquist frequency (1/2 the sampling frequency). The controller phase now
has a hump due to the derivative lead action and filtering. (Graphic courtesy
of ExperTune Loop Simulator.) </p>

<p>The time response is less oscillatory than with the PI
controller. Derivative action has helped stabilize the loop. </p>

<h3>Control Loop Tuning</h3>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that understanding the process
is fundamental to getting a well designed control loop. Sensors
must be in appropriate locations and valves must be sized
correctly with appropriate trim. </p>

<p>In general, for the tightest loop control, the dynamic
controller gain should be as high as possible without causing the
loop to be unstable. Choosing a controller gain is accomplished easily
with PID Tuning Software</p>



<h3><a name="FineTune"></a>Fine Tuning "Rules"</h3>

<p>This picture (from the <a href="http://www2.metso.com/LoopSimulator.aspx">Loop Simulator</a>) shows the effects of a
PI controller with too much or too little P or I action. The
process is typical with a dead time of 4 and lag time of 10.
Optimal is red. </p>

<p>You can use the picture to recognize the shape of an optimally
tuned loop. Also see the response shape of loops with I or P too
high or low. To get your process response to compare, put the
controller in manual change the output 5 or 10%, then put the
controller back in auto. </p>

<p>P is in units of proportional band. I is in units of
time/repeat. So increasing P or I, <i>decreases</i> their action
in the picture. </p>

These settings are rough, assume proper control loop design, ideal or
series algorithm and do not apply to all controllers.  Use Expertune's
PID Loop Optimizer to find the proper PID
settings for your process and controller.
